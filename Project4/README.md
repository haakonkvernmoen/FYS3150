# Estimating the critical temperature of a ferromagnetic materialusing the 2D Ising model

This repository contains a report and code for a numerical study our the 2D Ising model. This was a collaboration between [Bror Amund Flaten Hjemgaard](https://github.com/brorh), [Carl Martin Fevang](https://github.com/carlmfe) and me. The report (located in the report directory) details out our implementation approach, optimization and discussion conserning the Ising model. The code directory contains a all code used and a description in how to use it. All figures are saved to the figures directory.
