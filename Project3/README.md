# The solar system and modifed gravity

This repository contains a report and code for a numerical study our solar system, as well as some  investigation into modified gravity. This was a collaboration between [Bror Amund Flaten Hjemgaard](https://github.com/brorh), [Carl Martin Fevang](https://github.com/carlmfe) and me. The report (located in the report directory) details out our implementation approach, applications and discussion conserning the solar system and gravity. The code directory contains a all code used and a detailed description in how to use it. The figures directory contains different figures produced and used in our report. Below the solar system for 25 years and 100 years forward in time is shown (starting at March 14. 2018)
